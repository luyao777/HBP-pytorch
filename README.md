# HBP-pytorch
A third-party reimplementation of Hierarchical Bilinear Pooling for Fine-Grained Visual Recognition in Pytorch.

The related paper is as follows:
    
    Hierarchical Bilinear Pooling for Fine-Grained Visual Recognition[C]
    Chaojian Yu, Xinyi Zhao, Qi Zheng, Peng Zhang, Xinge You*
    European Conference on Computer Vision. 2018.

Official Caffe implementation of Hierarchical Bilinear Pooling for Fine-Grained Visual Recognition is [HERE](https://github.com/ChaojianYu/Hierarchical-Bilinear-Pooling)

Based on my code and experimental results, it is far from the result of the original author.

HBP_fc.py 80.42%

HBP_all.py 84.41%

So you can use it as a reference for learning.

This code borrows from [HERE](https://github.com/HaoMood/bilinear-cnn)

Happy coding.
